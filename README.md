# Salvod’art: The AI Art Guessing Game

Salvod’art is an intelligent system designed to guess the painting you're thinking of by asking a series of questions. You have three options to respond: **yes**, **no**, or **don’t know**. The system narrows down its possibilities based on your answers, and after two guesses, if it’s still wrong, it admits defeat. At this point, you can provide the painting's title and artist if you wish.

### Game Flow:
1. **Visualize** the painting you want to be guessed.
2. **Answer** the system’s questions.
3. After two wrong guesses, **provide** the painting's name and artist.
